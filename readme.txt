The intention of this project is to help actuaries be better at what we do. This project aims to:

CENTRE OF EXCELLENCE
* produce reusable models: actuaries must stop reinventing the wheel
* produce canonical model designs: standardisation across the industry
* produce peer reviewed models: the model design and documentation is extensively peer reviewed; this should reduce the model error that is prevalent within actuarial models implemented in industry today
* produce tested models with canonical test harnesses: to faciliate implementation of models into your favourite modelling platform
* produce verbosely documented models: a model is only useful if other actuaries can understand the model's strengths and weaknesses; and can follow the model specification, implementation and testing approach with ease.
* produce a community: as a community we can collaborate to solve problems and * produce better solutions than we can as individuals;

CENTRE OF LEARNING
* create a place of learning: modelling is a skill that can be taught.
